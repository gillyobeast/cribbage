Rules
---
Rules for a two-player game are as follows:

1. Game starts with each player cutting the deck. Player with the lowest card (aces low) is the
   first dealer, and gets the first crib.
2. If at any point a player reaches a score of 121, that player wins and the game ends.
3. The deal: each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, starting with the dealer. Each then chooses
   two cards to discard to the crib. The crib is put aside for use later. The non-dealing player
   cuts the deck and the top card of the bottom half becomes 'the cut' and is left on top of the
   deck, visible to both players. If the cut is a Jack of any suit, the dealer scores two points.
4. The play:
    - Players alternate playing cards until they have no cards that will take the total for this
      round of play over 31. Once both players have played all of their cards, the game moves on
      to the show.
    - Each player announces the running total after they place their card.
    - If a player has a card that will not take the total over 31, they must play it.
    - A player can score in one of four ways:
        1. Being the last player to be able to play, scoring two points if the total reaches 31, and
           one point otherwise. The total resets to 0 and players continue playing - scoring 
           plays do not continue from previous cards.
        2. Playing a card that takes the total to 15, scoring one point.
        3. Playing a card that matches the previous card in value, scoring twp points for a pair,
           six for a triple, and twelve for a full set of four.
        4. Playing a card that continues a run of three or more cards in any order, scoring as many
           points as cards in the run. For example, if the previous two cards are a 4 and a 6,
           playing a 5 scores three points.
    - All scores for placing a card are counted - for example, if the last three cards played are a
      King, a 2, and a 3, and the total is 30, then a player playing an Ace earns them three
      points for completing a run of three and a further two points for finishing the play on 31.
