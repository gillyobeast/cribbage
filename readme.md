Rules
---
Rules for a two-player game are as follows:

1. Game starts with each player cutting the deck. Player with the lowest card (aces low) is the
   first dealer, and gets the first crib.
2. The deal: each player is dealt a hand of 6 cards, starting with the dealer. Each then chooses
   two cards to discard to the crib. The crib is put aside for use later. The non-dealing player
   cuts the deck and the top card of the bottom becomes 'the cut' and is left on top of the deck,
   visible to both players. If the cut is a Jack of any suit, the dealer scores two points.
3. The play: non-dealer starts, laying a card on the table face-up.
